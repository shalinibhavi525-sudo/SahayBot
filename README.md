# 🆘 SahayBot - AI Crisis Companion

> Your personal safety net during life's hardest moments

## 🎯 The Problem

**When crisis strikes, people need immediate, intelligent support:**
- 💔 Mental health crises often happen at night when helplines are unavailable
- 🌊 Natural disasters leave people confused about what to do
- 🏥 Medical emergencies need quick, accurate first-aid guidance
- 😰 People don't know which helpline to call for their specific situation

**Current solutions fail because:**
- ❌ Helplines have limited hours and long wait times
- ❌ Generic advice doesn't account for crisis type
- ❌ People don't know what resources exist
- ❌ No intelligent triage system exists

## 💡 The Solution

**SahayBot** is an AI companion that:
1. 🧠 **Detects crisis type** from your message (mental health, disaster, medical, violence)
2. 🎯 **Provides contextual support** based on severity and situation
3. 📞 **Connects you to the right helpline** intelligently
4. 💡 **Offers immediate coping strategies** while help is on the way
5. 🔒 **Protects your privacy** - no data stored, no tracking

**Think of it as: EchoAid + SafeSteps + Emergency Response, all in one intelligent system**
